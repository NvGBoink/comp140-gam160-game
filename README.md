# -Summary Of Game-
In Shock players will find themselves in an abandoned warehouse during the dead of night. The goal of the game is a retreive 3 fuses in order to get the lights back on. With all the lights being out though, the playerâ€™s only source of light comes from a single wind up torch. On top of this the warehouse is also infested with light fearing creatures whose survival depends on the player not getting the lights back on. As the creatures are able to kill the player in a single touch the player must use their torch to both easily find their way towards the fuses and scare the creatures away from the. Issue the players will run into with this is the limited power that the torch has. The only way to recharge the torch is to wind it up using the crank on the side. 

# -Game Mechanics-
Player movement:
----------------
The player movement is a simple first person character controller. Controlled using the analog stick located on the top of the controller the player can move left, right, backwards and forwards. The rotation might be handled in two ways depending on time and cost.

Power management:
-----------------
Power management is the core of the gameplay mechanic. The creatures that are the threat in the game will only move when in complete darkness. The player will not be able to see the creatures very well when little light is available to them. These elements add up to a mechanic that requires the player to both make sure they use their power wisely and to also charge their torch in times where they know they are safe. 
In addition to this the frantic action of winding a torch up adds to the intense experience of playing a horror game.
Threats:
The core threat of the game is the light fearing creatures. These creatures only move when close to complete darkness, with the exception of a few gas lamps the only light in the game will come from the players torch. When the player shines the torch in the direction of any creature they will stop moving until the light runs out or the player moves away from them.
If the creature comes into collision with the player the player will die and the game will start again.

Goal:
-----
The goal of the game is to collect 3 fuses from around the level and to bring them back. This is a simple mechanic thats main goal is to make the player move along a certain path and then to walk back along that path. This works well with the threat of the game as a player will probably run into a creature one the way to a fuse and then have to walk past it again when returning to the fuse box.
